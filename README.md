## Build With

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.
* [WanDB](https://wandb.ai/) - Build better models faster with experiment tracking, dataset versioning, and model management.
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) - Used to build information extraction, natural language understanding systems, and to pre-process text for deep learning.
* [Tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) - Instantly make your loops show a smart progress meter.

## Some screenshots during this project
### After 4 trainings i compared results about different dropouts on Training dataset and choose dropout value of my model witch gives me smaller error
